This application uses the ioutil package to read the files in the specified directory, and the net/http package to make HTTP requests to the API. It uses a for loop to continuously check for new files in the directory, and calls the API with the file path when a new file is detected.


To use this application, you will need to specify the URL of the API in the apiURL constant, and the path to the directory that you want to monitor in the dir constant. 


You can modify the time.Sleep call to adjust the interval at which the application checks for new files.
